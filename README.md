Collection of small projects as I learn to code in Python â€” inspirations and guidelines from Youtube, Daily Python Projects, ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Claude.

Goal projects for 2025H2 (and writing this out will help me commit):
  1. GBBO bracket for the upcoming season
  2. Orange fruit detection on my phone

Future projects once I'm comfortable:
  - AR art and picture hanging tool
  - Enhancing VHS conversions

Practice branch:
  - OpenCV explorations - dumping ground right now for foundational elements
